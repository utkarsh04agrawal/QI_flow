This folder contains numerical code to run Boundary dissipation problem. The left end of a 1d quantum spin chain is connected to a depolarization channel.

This problem admits a simple description in terms of Domain Wall (DW) where a DW starts from position x=0 (left boundary). The left boundary has dissipation which acts as repulsion for the DW. The right side is an attractor for the DW.
