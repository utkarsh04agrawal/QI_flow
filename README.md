# QI_flow
This project studies the flow of quantum information (QI) in a quantum system in presence of an environement E. E tries to steal the QI. There is an observer O which tries to counter E by extracting the QI itself. Since O is accessible to the quantum system S it can help prevent the QI leaking to E.
